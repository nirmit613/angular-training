Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book\'s title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat\'s cover art greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated aspects of it into the novel.'
